To install, run:

    CODER_HTTP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:3000
    
    # String. The URL of a PostgreSQL database to connect to. If empty, PostgreSQL binaries
    # will be downloaded from Maven (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2) and store all

    CODER_PG_CONNECTION_URL=
    
    # Boolean. Specifies if TLS will be enabled.
    CODER_TLS_ENABLE=

    CODER_TLS_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:3443
    
    # String. Specifies the path to the certificate for TLS. It requires a PEM-encoded file.

    # String. Specifies the path to the private key for the certificate. It requires a
    # PEM-encoded file.
    CODER_TLS_KEY_FILE=
    
# To run Coder as a system service on the host:

    # Use systemd to start Coder now and on reboot
    sudo systemctl enable --now coder 
    # View the logs to ensure a successful start
    journalctl -u coder.service -b
    
##### To restart Coder after applying system changes:
